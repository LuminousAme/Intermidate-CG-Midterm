Intermidate Computer Graphics Midterm - INFR 2350 - Ame Gilham #100741352

I made all the models myself in blender 

I additionally drew all the textures with the exception of the texture on the ground plane myself using blender's texture paint mode 

The ground texture is an open source texture obtained from the following website: https://pdtextures.blogspot.com/2008/03/eighteenth-set.html
and then resized in a photoshop to have a width divisable by 4 (requirement for Titan's texture implemntation)
